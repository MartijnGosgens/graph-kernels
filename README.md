# README

The experiments require [grakel](https://github.com/ysig/GraKeL), [networkx](https://networkx.org/) and [igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/stable/).

To generate graphs and perform the experiment, simply run the file `spearman_experiment.py` with python:

```
python spearman_experiment.py
```

To generate a latex table, run `latex_tables.py`, and to generate the figures, run `plot_all.py`.
